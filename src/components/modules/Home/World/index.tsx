            A small gust of wind flew across Damienâ€™s face, as he gazed through the forest finding no signs of life. He was standing on a small grassy road in the middle of the night. Small lantern posts were spread across both sides of the road, with trees surrounding the whole area. "Is this the right way?" Damien thought to himself, as he wandered into the darkness.
            <br /><br />
            In the age of Enlightenment, Damien, husband and father, is returning to his home village of Blackmill after receiving a letter from his wife. Upon arrival he discovers that everything seems abandoned. Fearing for his family he enters the village and searches for clues of the events that have occurred there.
